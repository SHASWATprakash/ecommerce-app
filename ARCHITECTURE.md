# E-commerce API Architecture

## System Overview

This e-commerce API is built using TypeScript, Express.js, and Firebase, deployed on Vercel as serverless functions. The system provides CRUD operations for products and search functionality.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Serverless Functions)

## Data Flow

1. Client sends a request to a specific endpoint.
2. The request is routed through Vercel to the appropriate serverless function.
3. Express.js handles the routing to the correct controller.
4. The controller interacts with Firebase Firestore to perform the requested operation.
5. The result is sent back to the client as a JSON response.

## Security

- Firebase Admin SDK is used for secure server-side access to Firestore.
- Environment variables are used to store sensitive information.
- Vercel provides SSL encryption for all API endpoints.

## Scalability

- Serverless architecture allows for automatic scaling based on demand.
- Firebase Firestore provides a scalable NoSQL database solution.

## Future Improvements

- Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Add caching layer for frequently accessed data.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
